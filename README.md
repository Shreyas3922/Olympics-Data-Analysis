## Olympics Data Analysis Using Python
we are going to see the Olympics analysis using Python. The modern Olympic Games or Olympics are leading international sports events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the worldâ€™s foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating.
The total number of events in the Olympics is 339 in 33 sports. And for every event there are winners. Therefore various data is generated. So, by using Python we will analyze this data.
### Modules Used
* [Pandas](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pandas-dataframe/): It is used for analyzing the data.
* [Numpy](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-numpy/):  NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package.
* [Matplotlib](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-introduction-matplotlib/): It is a numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
* [Seaborn](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-seaborn-python/): It is used for visualization statistical graphics plotting in Python.

### Stepwise Implementation
* Step1: Install and import libraries
* Step2: Understanding Database
* When dealing with Olympic data, we have two CSV files. One containing outturn sports-related costs of the Olympic Games of all years. And other is containing the information about athletes of all years when they participated with information.  Datasets can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19dCkREUadXgET8rbdKyhJ4nYgLcK-j_a?usp=sharing)
* Step3: Data cleaning and formatting
* Step4: Merging two DataFrame
* Step5: Data ANalysis on the merged Data.
